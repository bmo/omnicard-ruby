# omnicard-ruby

A gem to interact with Omnicard's API

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

An omnicard account, and a user set up with API access is necessary to use this.
Set up environment variables with the login information to use the examples:
```
export OMNICARD_USER=someone@somewhere.com
export OMNICARD_PASSWORD=some_long_and_strong_password
# now you can use the examples in the examples directory. 
```
If you have an IDE, like [Rubymine](https://jetbrains.com), you could set up a configuration with these values for quickly iterating with the example programs.

You're probably going to want to have a copy of the Omnicard API to reference. Contact Omnicard for that.

### Installing

Install the Gem. Try the sample programs in the examples directory.

## Running the tests
TBD
